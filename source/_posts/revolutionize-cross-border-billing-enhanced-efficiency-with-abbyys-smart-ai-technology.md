## ABBYY Purpose-built AI Helps Scale and Streamline Invoice Processes Across 20 Markets and 14 Languages

![pathner logo](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/logos-white/abbyy.png?h=40&iar=0&w=120)

A multinational snack food supplier needed a solution to better manage and scale its diverse invoice-to-pay processes in place across some 20 markets and 14 languages worldwide. Powered by AI, ABBYY’s intelligent document processing (IDP) platform delivered faster invoice approval times with greater accuracy, sending a much higher percentage of invoices straight through to the ERP.

Instead of having to hire 50% or 75% more people to keep up with our growing volume of invoices, we wanted to find ways to aid that process through automation and reset what our team was working on day-to-day.

Senior Manager for Automation Development and Governance

### Challenge

The multinational food supplier was having difficulty scaling its invoice-to-pay processes to keep up with the company’s growth. AP business rules and workflows varied widely across 20 markets in 14 languages—stored primarily as local tribal knowledge rather than formally documented.

The organization looked for a solution that would efficiently process all invoice variations across markets in order to:

* Reduce both data entry errors and the number of times staff needed to handle the same document
* Scale local AP processes to keep up with growth without increasing headcount
* Integrate with robotic process automation (RPA) to help streamline the flow of invoices and data downstream
* Document tribal knowledge

### Solution

The advanced AI technology in ABBYY’s IDP enables faster invoice approval times with greater accuracy, and many more invoices posted directly to the ERP.

Natural language processing (NLP) analyzes the semantics of invoices to help the ERP make sense of the many variations of invoice content.

Machine learning (ML) helps train AI models on all the different types of documents received and uses inference to process new invoice formats.

The organization’s robotic process automation (RPA) leverages the AI in ABBYY IDP components to help streamline the flow of invoices and data downstream.

### Value

* Automated and standardized AP processes globally
* Flexibly fits the unique practices of vendors and local AP teams
* Unlocks the strategic value of AP data
* Identifies anomalous transactions that might indicate fraud
* Makes tribal knowledge of AP staff more available
