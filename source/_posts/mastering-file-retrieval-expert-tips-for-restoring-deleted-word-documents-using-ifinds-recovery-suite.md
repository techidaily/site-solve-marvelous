We try to give you the easiest way for various versions to search and find the autorecover files.

| Word 2003/2007      | Use Windows to search the files \*.ASD, then use Word to open. |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Word 2010           | File – Recent – Recover Unsaved Documents                      |
| Word 2013/2016/2019 | File – Open – Recent – Recover Unsaved Documents               |

## **Method 3:** Recover Unsaved Word Documents from word backup files

![word backup](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/word-backup.jpg?resize=640%2C229&ssl=1)

First, you need to select the “Always create backup copy” option in File – Options – Advanced. Then, the word will store a \*.wbk backup file for you. So you have a chance to recover the unsaved files by using these backup files.

The easiest way to get the backup files is also using windows search for \*.wbk files. A little more hit, they are usually also named by “Backup of”+” your original filename”. After you locate the files, all you need to do is using word to open it. Remember to change the file type to all so that you can let the backup files appear in your browser.

## **Method 4:** Recover Unsaved Word Documents from word temporary files

![word tmp](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/word-tmp.jpg?resize=552%2C168&ssl=1)

If you still got no luck with the tips above, you can try the word temporary files to restore unsaved word documents. They are the files with the extension of “.tmp”, and a part of the temp file name begins with the character “\~”.

However, the tmp extension is for all windows temporary files, and you will get an enormous amount of results if you search the extension in the entire computer. So we may narrow down the File Directories for searching such as the path of your original files and word cache locations.

## Best Practices for your Word Documents Safety

If you use word heavily for work or life, here are some tips for avoid the pain of unsaved word document.

* Buy an Office 365 subscription if you can. The new cloud-based office allows you to use the unique Autosave function with cloud storage like OneDrive. This combination is the safest system to keep your word files safe so far.
* Save your files timely. There are always risks that autosave and autorecover can’t recover your file right!
* Use fewer plugins, keep your word stable. The word crashed is usually caused by some plugin which let you lose the data, and not every crash can trigger the word autorecover!
* Turn on your Autosave/Autorecover in word options to make sure the word will save your files when shit happens.
* Open the word files from trusted source, Using the well-known anti-virus software to avoid the virus attack for Microsoft word.

Also, we may also face other problems besides word document not saved, such as lost word document, deleted word document and even corrupted word file for recovering.
