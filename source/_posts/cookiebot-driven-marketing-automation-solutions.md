ABBYY®, a global provider of content intelligence solutions and services, and Panasonic System Solutions Company of North America, Division of Panasonic Corporation of North America, are pleased to announce a new agreement to include the award-winning document conversion software, ABBYY FineReader 12 Sprint for Panasonic, free in-the-box with the purchase of any Panasonic KV-S1015, KV-S1026, KV-S1027 and KV-S1057 desktop document scanner. This software makes it easy to scan paper documents using a Panasonic scanner and convert them into searchable PDFs and editable formats such as Microsoft Word and Excel.

The highly accurate FineReader Sprint for Panasonic software eliminates the need to retype or reformat documents, while also improving the overall quality of your scans. Users can operate their Panasonic desktop document scanner to not only scan documents of all shapes and sizes, but also improve the overall quality of images taken with mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Scanning can be performed individually and merged into one file, or captured as a batch including documents of mixed lengths and sizes. ABBYY FineReader is internationally recognized having received more than 250 awards from leading labs and magazines and supports 190 different recognition languages, including Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Arabic.

“Panasonic and ABBYY have been working together for many years with the goal of customer convenience at the core of their collaboration. “Now customers can enjoy faster and better ways to work with their Panasonic scanner using FineReader technology. It’s sophisticated yet easy to use. People will be impressed with what Panasonic is providing as a value to their high-quality scanning hardware,” said Dean Tang, Executive Vice President for Global Accounts at ABBYY.

“Panasonic is known for the high-quality of its hardware and an industry-leading warranty of 3 years. Combined with the added value of including the ABBYY FineReader 12 Sprint for Panasonic software at no additional charge in-the-box with our desktop scanners, purchasing a Panasonic scanner is not only a good hardware choice, customers also get a leading productivity software at their fingertips,” says Fred Scherman, National Sales Manager, Panasonic Systems Solutions Company of North America.

ABBYY FineReader for Windows is a powerful PDF editing application with underlying OCR capabilities of exceptional accuracy, for increasing business productivity when working with documents. It provides versatile easy-to-use tools to access and modify information locked in PDF documents and scans.
