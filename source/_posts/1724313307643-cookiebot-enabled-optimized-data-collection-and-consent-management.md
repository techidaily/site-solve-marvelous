Scena, a UK creative construction and protective solutions company, leveraged ABBYY’s Digital Intelligence solution to automate their invoice & credit notes process. The combined ABBYY and Engeneum invoice processing solution removed the need for time consuming manual entry. This saved Scena 60% of the time it took to process invoices and provided the finance team with more time to concentrate on managing the data and exploit direct Sage ™ Link.

###### Challenge

Scena's invoice processing was costly in terms of labor, time and disruption. 

###### Solution

###### Results

Invoice-processing time reduced by 60%; by removing manual work, Scena freed up time for its accountants to focus on high-value tasks.

#### Challenge
