## How Much Does Data Recovery Cost and How to Permanently Avoid Data Recovery Cost in 2024?

* ![data recovery cost](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/data-recovery-cost.jpg)

There is no difference between **how much does data recovery cost** and how much does hard drive data recovery cost. You may experience data loss due to many reasons, including software/system malfunctions, hardware failures, human errors, virus attacks, and more. Due to this, the cost of hard drive data recovery varies from case to case.

In this article, we’d like to share some important information about the different levels of data loss. Before you search for how much does it cost for data recovery, you need to get to know what level your data loss situation is. We divide the hard drive data loss into 3 levels.

**Level 1 (Easy): Human or Software Error**

At this level, the hard drive is entirely functional. You may delete the file or format the drive by accident. Or you may face a system crash or virus attack. All in all, nothing is hardware-related.

**Level 2 (Easy): Hard Drive Internal Issues**

![hard drive pcb](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hard-drive-pcb.jpg?resize=640%2C425&ssl=1)

Some parts of your hard drive may be damaged or broken, which causes the hard drive fail to use. For instance, typically PCB failure is caused by a power surge or Firewall damage.

**Level 3 (Hard): Hard Drive Physical Damages**

![clean room](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/clean-room.jpg?resize=640%2C357&ssl=1)

In this level, a “clean room” is needed for data recovery(which is expensive). Typically with R/W heads Failure, Frozen Spindle/Motors and mechanical damages.

At this level, a “clean room” is needed for data recovery. Typically with R/W heads Failure, Frozen Spindle/Motors, and mechanical damages.

Apart from the hard drive, We also like to use Flash drives and SSD drives to store and carry our data. Unlike the traditional HDDs, there is NO mechanical part in flash and SSD drives, So the cost is mostly in Level 1 and 2 zones, more or less.

There are also some hard drives used in devices like RAID or Storage Networking, and basically, **the recovery cost fee is added up by the number of hard drives.**

Well, we know the levels of data loss now, what’s next? Here comes a comparison table between 2 common data recovery methods including expensive data recovery services and inexpensive data recovery software or free tools.

**Full Test Review: Data Recovery Service vs Data Recovery Software?**

**Option 1: Data Recovery Service**

As a technical company, a data recovery service (should) have the most high-tech and professional equipment and experts, like the “clean room” we talk about above, they handle all the diagnosis and recovery jobs for you. All you need to do is pay the bill, and definitely, it’s not a few dozen dollars. And indifferent countries and districts, the cost of hard drive data recovery varies. For instance, data recovery costs in the States and Australia are totally at different prices.

**Option 2: Data Recovery Software**

Using [data recovery software](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/) is like a DIY data recovery process. You get the free/paid software, download and install it, and follow the software guide to search for and finally recover your lost data. It may take you less time and money than a data recovery service.

| **Data Recovery Service** | **Data Recovery Software**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Capacity**              | Usually, data recovery services can recover all levels of hard drive data loss from level 1 to level 3, as well as for flash drive, SSD, and [Raid recovery](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/).                                                                                                                     | Usually, data recovery software can recover level 1 data loss with any human or software errors, and even level 2 data recovery which requires you to have some easy technical skills. But for level 3, just look for professional data recovery services.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Cost**                  | As a professional service, the cost is more expensive. For the data recovery service in the USA, level 1 recovery starts at $300, level 2 starts at $500, and level 3 for $800, But the cost may change a lot depending on different situations. According to a recent survey: recovering a NAS or RAID array ranges from $1,000 to $10,000. | There are both free and paid software in the market. For free data recovery tools, there are usually some limits to function and capability. For paid ones, you can get decent data recovery software for about $59-150\. If the cost of a paid data recovery is too low, you’d better not try for it, cause it possibly can’t recover your wanted data and may cause data overwritten and loss. |
| **Usability and Support** | The company takes care of everything. All you have to do is send the hard drive by mail or drop it off at their office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | You may spend some time learning how to use it to diagnose, search, and recover your files. Also, there’s email/online/phone assistance from customer support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Time Cost**             | In general, most data recovery projects can be completed between two and five days. You may need to wait longer (perhaps 6-10 days) if the hard drive fails for a specific or serious reason.                                                                                                                                                | To recover a 500GB hard drive, it can take up to three hours. 1TB hard drives are usually recovered within 5 hours. It depends on the situation, however, how long it takes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Results**               | There are lots of data recovery services that offer “No data No Charge” today. You only pay for the recovered data, sounds good right? However, there are also some companies do charge for diagnosis and other stuff.                                                                                                                       | Even the best data recovery software can’t promise you can get the data back every time. Fortunately, there are lots of recovery software with a free or trial version that can let you test if your data can be found and recovered.                                                                                                                                                            |
