ABBYY, a global leader in purpose-built AI for intelligent automation, has announced the appointment of **Jae Park as Vice President of Sales for the Asia-Pacific (APAC)** region. Jae will leverage his 30 years of experience driving high-performing sales teams in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan to rapidly grow new revenue streams for ABBYY.

[Forrester estimates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2022/11/10/the-top-2023-predictions-for-technology-in-apac/?sh=eb24435193c6) process intelligence will be used to reinvigorate 20% of failing robotic process automation (RPA) projects in the APAC region and that [30% of firms](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2023/10/26/in-2024-apac-firms-will-be-inspired-by-the-generative-ai-wave/?sh=2722a608482e) are focused on using generative AI to evolve their business in 2024\. ABBYY’s portfolio of intelligent automation solutions provide organizations with purpose-built AI to transform the data from documents to fuel generative AI models and process intelligence solutions to not only identify automation opportunities but also enable monitoring, predictive, and simulation capabilities.

Jae’s extensive experience in understanding customers’ digital transformation needs and working closely with them to achieve their intelligent automation goals are indispensable in a time when organizations are struggling with RPA failures and wanting to take advantage of the generative AI possibilities.  
Having yielded tremendous growth for several reputable technology vendors and developers in the APAC region throughout his career, I’m confident that Jae’s leadership will deliver remarkable growth for ABBYY.”

Neil Murphy, Chief Sales Officer at ABBYY

Prior to joining ABBYY, Park led sales at UiPath, Pegasystems, Software AG, and Teradata, as well as various roles in technology in the United States, APAC and Middle East regions.

Like the rest of the world, Asia experienced a period of volatility in 2023 with inflation and rising interest rates, resulting in mixed results for corporations  
But in my view, the common theme prevalent in Asia’s vast and distinct marketplaces is the importance of producing hypergrowth and pragmatic results through technology initiatives – specifically in the areas of digital transformation and AI. I’m excited to lead a team of talented individuals who are empathetic to the challenges unique to each of our customers and the countries they serve.
