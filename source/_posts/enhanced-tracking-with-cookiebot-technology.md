IDP Overview 

Put Your Information to Work Avasant Research Deep Analysis Everest Group GigaOm IDC Infosource NelsonHall Quadrant Knowledge Solutions Zinnov ABBYY is the authority in knowing how to process any document in any language any time. ABBYY is the recognized market leader in IDP by the following analyst ﬁrms: Put your information to work. Business and technology leaders are looking for opportunities to improve cost and productivity efﬁciencies within their organization. A strategic approach to achieve this is by making the revenue-generating information stuck within documents more accessible and using it to generate more business value. Intelligent document processing (IDP) applies optical character recognition (OCR), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technology to read, extract, and understand structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents like a human. Every business has high volumes of documents running through enterprise systems; IDP enables a faster, more accurate and efﬁcient way to put this information to work. The purpose of this report is to help organizations understand the beneﬁts of IDP and how different regions and organizations use it to their advantage. Benefits of intelligent document processing (IDP) 2 

Key trends Regional Differences Data reflected regional differences in enterprises’ document challenges. North America had greater need for Document Skills related to tax forms; Europe and Asia-Pacific priorities are related to transportation and logistics. Regional Similarities Data shows strong similarities between the regions’ need to accelerate the processing of invoices and identity documents and use connectors for augmenting intelligent automation platforms with advanced IDP solutions. Forecast IDP is expected to experience significant growth driven by trends in supply chain and logistics. Most enterprises wanted connectors for Microsoft Power Automate, indicating the need for a better way to transform data for integrating within Microsoft environments. 3 

Making document processing easier Intelligent document processing can be applied to any document in any language for any industry, whether it originated originated digitally or on paper. As industry dynamics change and document requirements evolve, organizations need to be able to adapt their document processing solutions to stay agile and efficient. There are two approaches to IDP. A batch-first platform is open and extensible, allowing trained administrators to easily customize and orchestrate the behavior of the system, including extraction models, business rules (scripting), custom routing, exception handling, classification and separation models, and scanner controls based upon a Microsoft Windows platform. Designed to process large volumes of documents primarily submitted in batches, it is suited for customers who have dedicated teams supporting capture and data extraction for production imaging use cases. Another approach is in response to emerging market trends and demands where automation teams require pre-trained, transactional document processing models that are easily deployed and supported by plugging right into their core systems and applications. It is a low code/no code approach to IDP that empowers the citizen developer by removing much of the complexity associated with production document capture applications. It is highly optimized for transactional processes unlike platforms designed for more batch offerings. Additionally, this approach offers pre-trained document skills that are already trained on specific document types and can be used to immediately process documents. They are optimized to plug into intelligent automation platforms such as robotic process automation (RPA), business process management (BPM), and modern transactionally-focused workflow systems, and are equipped to submit data and documents in real-time (i.e., you do not have to wait for the entire batch to finish before an export takes place). 4 

Regional Document Priorities 

Document needs by region US + Canada 1\. IRS 1040 – Individual Income Tax Return 2\. Identity Documents 3\. Invoice 4\. Bank Statement 5\. Remittance Advice Asia-Paciﬁc 1\. Identity Documents 2\. Air Waybill 3\. Invoice 4\. Bank Statement 5\. Sea Waybill Europe 1\. Customs Declaration EU 2\. Identity Documents 3\. Air Waybill 4\. International Consignment Note CMR 5\. Invoice Document Skills are fully trained assets that can be used with ABBYY IDP for extracting key insights from specific document types. We segmented the most requested document skills in the United States and Canada, Asia-Pacific, and Europe to understand how enterprises’ document needs varied across regions. Across all three regions, organizations were looking to process identity-related documents to improve customer experiences through government agencies, invoices to accelerate finance and accounting processes, and transportation and logistics-related documents in response to global supply chain challenges. TOP DOCUMENT SKILLS REQUESTED PER REGION 6 

Market drivers ABBYY IDP data in the United States and Canada reflect a need for better tax form processing skills, as well as other finance-oriented skills such as bank statements and invoices. This trend can be attributed to tax deadlines in April for both the US and Canada. Document trends: US + Canada Top Five Document Priorities in North America Bank Statement 15% 17% 29% IRS 1040 22% Identity Documents 17% Invoice Vehicle Registration 7 

Market drivers ABBYY IDP data in Europe shows high prioritization of document skills related to international travel and commerce, such as customs declarations, identity documents, international consignment notes, and air waybills. This can be attributed to travel and commerce between the EU and non-EU member countries, particularly Great Britain following Brexit.
