DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia, with over 280 branches across 18 markets. Headquartered and listed in Singapore, DBS has a growing presence in the three key Asian axes of growth: Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. The bank’s capital position, as well as “AA” and “Aa1” credit ratings, are among the highest in Asia-Pacific.

#### Challenge

DBS has been steadily investing in strategic technology initiatives, digitizing its offerings and leveraging new technology to provide customers with a differentiated experience. In recent years, the bank has introduced several first-of-their-kind features in the digital space to ensure that customers enjoy a simple yet convenient banking experience with DBS.

One of DBS Bank’s latest offerings is DBS Quick Credit – a mobile app that allows users to apply for loans on the go. It is beneficial both to its users and to the bank, since it speeds up and simplifies loans application process.

Beyond providing customers the ability to apply for loans anytime, anywhere, DBS’ s ultimate aim was to relieve customers of the tedium of manually inserting personal data into application forms. Ideally, the fields would be automatically filled in – accurately yet with minimal time and effort required from the customer.

DBS sought a solution that would support automated extraction of data from photographed documents – and this is where ABBYY Mobile Optical Character Recognition SDK came in.
